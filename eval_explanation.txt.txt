The eval function checks row by row for entries of both the players and increases the utility by one if it finds player 1(AI agent) 
entry and reduces the utility by one if it finds an entry of the player 2(Human Player). 

It is a very simple eval fucntion, but will help AI agent win if the human player plays randomly.
